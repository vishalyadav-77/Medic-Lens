# Medic-Lens
there was a problem with some commits in this project and also i am shifting to another API source so **i will be disregarding this project** and make a new fresh one.

Medic Lens is a mobile app that lets users scan images of medicines for quick access to essential information, including names, ingredients, uses, dosage, side effects, and precautions. With a user-friendly interface, it enhances informed medication usage using AI technology.
